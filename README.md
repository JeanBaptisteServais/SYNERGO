<h1>Hand</h1>

  - <h2>Identifiy fingers</h2>

  <p> Here we need to detect to which finger belongs its points for that we must define distances according to the direction of the hand that it is lying and thus in width, or on the contrary in length. For that use <stron>the contours</strong> of the hand.

The model by ... detect almost always the thumb so we rely on the thumb. Next we search the next point of the thumb given above.

We have deduce max and mid finger's localisation as:

D(t, i) if i < w * 0.574 

    where t is thumb, i is index and w is the width of the contour 

And distance beetween finger's are egal to w * 0.295 or h * ...
